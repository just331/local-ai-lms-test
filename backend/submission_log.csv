1. **Logic Programming/Nonmonotonic Reasoning**: The student's answer does not mention the connection of ASP to logic programming or nonmonotonic reasoning. Suggest mentioning that ASP is based on these concepts.
   
2. **Difficult Search Problems**: The student does not refer to ASP's orientation towards difficult search problems. Recommend adding a statement about how ASP is oriented towards solving such problems.
